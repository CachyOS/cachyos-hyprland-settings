**CachyOS** is a distribution based on Arch Linux that offers an easy installation and several customization options to suit every user's needs. It also includes special optimizations for improved performance while remaining simple.

**Hyprland** is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots that doesn't sacrifice on its looks. It supports multiple layouts, fancy effects, and has a very flexible IPC model allowing for a lot of customization.

We would like to extend our gratitude to [flick0](https://github.com/flick0/dotfiles/tree/aurora), the creator of Hyprland's dotfiles, for their hard work and dedication.

This repository contains configuration files for various programs and tools used in the CachyOS Hyprland operating system. By using these configs, you can customize your system to better suit your needs and preferences.
